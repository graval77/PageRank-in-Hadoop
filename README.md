# PageRank-in-Hadoop
PageRank
is
an
iterative
algorithm,
so
you
will
implement
this
as
an
iterative
MapReduce.
Thus,
the
output
of
round
k
will
be
used
as
the
input
of
round
k+1.
In
addition,
we
will
need
three
additional
types
of
jobs:
One
for
converting
the
input
data
into
our
intermediate
format,
one
for
computing
how
much
the
rank
values
have
changed
from
one
round
to
the
next
(actually
made
up
of
two
MapReduce
jobs),
and
one
for
converting
the
intermediate
format
into
the
output
format.
